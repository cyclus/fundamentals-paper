\subsubsection{Discrete Facilities and Materials}

Many fuel cycle phenomena have aggregate system-level effects which can only be
captured by discrete material tracking \cite{huff_next_2010}.  \Cyclus
tracks materials as discrete objects. Some current fuel cycle simulation tools
such as \gls{COSI}
\cite{mccarthy_benchmark_2012,grasso_nea-wpfc/fcts_2009,guerin_benchmark_2009},
\gls{DESAE}
\cite{andrianova_desae_2008}, FAMILY21\cite{mccarthy_benchmark_2012},
\gls{GENIUS} version 1, \gls{GENIUS} version 2, and \gls{NFCSim} also possess the ability to
model discrete materials.

Similarly, the ability to model disruptions (i.e. facility shutdowns due to
insufficient feed material or insufficient processing and storage capacity) is
most readily captured by software capable of tracking the operations status of
discrete facilities \cite{huff_next_2010}.  Fleet-based models (i.e.
\gls{VISION}) are unable to capture this gracefully, perhaps representing it as 
a reduction in the capacity of the whole fleet.  All of the software
capable of discrete materials have a notion of discrete facilities, however not
all handle disruption in the same manner. \gls{DESAE}, for example, does not
allow shutdown due to insufficient feedstock. In the event
of insufficient fissile material during reprocessing, \gls{DESAE} borrows
material from storage, leaving a negative value \cite{mccarthy_benchmark_2012}.
The \Cyclus framework does not dictate such heuristics. Rather, it provides a
flexible framework on which either method is possible.

\subsubsection{Open Access}

% gonuke: I am perhaps oversensitive, but I perceive the status of 
%         VISION to be constantly shifting.  I am thus unsure whether
%         ``license agreemnts or instutional approval'' are currently
%         required for access to VISION.  I raise it here to satisfy
%         my desire to have it categorically confirmed by someone.

The proprietary concerns of research institutions and security constraints of
data within fuel cycle simulators often restrict access. Use of a simulator is
therefore often limited to its institution of origin, necessitating effort
duplication at other institutions and thereby squandering broader human
resources. License agreements and institutional approval are required for most
current simulators (i.e. \gls{COSI}6, \gls{DANESS}, \gls{DESAE}, EVOLCODE,
FAMILY21, \gls{NFCSim})\cite{juchau_modeling_2010}, ORION, and VISION.  Even when, as in
the case of the MIT \gls{CAFCA} software, the source code is unrestricted, the
platform on which it relies is often restricted or costly.  However, \Cyclus
provides fully free and open access to all users
and developers, foreign and domestic.

\subsubsection{Flexibility and Extensibility}

In addition to being inaccessible, the vast majority of fuel cycle simulators
are, effectively, inextensible. Typical fuel cycle simulator development teams are insular, in
part due to aforementioned accessibility issues. Accordingly, their frameworks
typically contain heuristics and assumptions that constrain developer additions.

For example, most current simulators describe a finite set of acceptable
cycle constructions (once through, single-pass, multi-pass). That limits the
capability to create novel material flows and economic scenarios. The \Cyclus
simulation logic relies on a market paradigm, parameterized by the user, which
flexibly simulates dynamic responses to pricing, availability, and other
institutional preferences. This is an advanced level of flexibility that does
not exist in other fuel cycle simulators.
