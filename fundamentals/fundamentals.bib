The code uses the matrix exponential method to solve a large system of coupled, linear, first-order ordinary differential equations with constant coefficients.  The general nature of the matrix exponential method permits the treatment of complex decay and transmutation schemes.  An extensive library of nuclear data has been compiled, including half-lives and decay schemes, neutron absorbtion, cross sections, fission yields, disintegration energies, and multigroup photon release data.  ORIGEN has been used to compute the compositions and radiactivity of fission products, cladding materials, and fuel materials in LWRs, LMFBRs, MSBRs, and HTGRs.  The applications are illustrated with calculated inventories and radiation levels for spent fuel irradiated to a burnup of 33,000 MWd/metric ton in a PWR spectrum.},

	abstract = {The dynamic analysis of multiple development paths for nuclear energy systems has gained interest worldwide. Especially in the light of the different roadmap exercises that have been undertaken in the past years indicating the need for symbiotic nuclear energy systems in the longer term. The symbiosis between different nuclear reactor types and their associated fuel cycle should fulfill competing objectives for such systems, i.e. economics, environmental friendliness, resource longevity, waste management, and non-proliferation. A new code, dubbed DANESS, has been developed which allows performing such dynamic analysis of nuclear energy systems composed of multiple reactors and fuel cycle options including cross-flow of fissile material between the different components of the system. Today, the code allows mass-flow analysis and economics and is currently being extended to include life-cycle analysis data, non-proliferation metrics and non-nuclear energy sources. This paper will describe the main features of this code and will indicate the possible uses and future developments.},

	doi = {http://dx.doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.1134652},
	abstract = {The CYCLUS Fuel Cycle Simulator is a framework for assessment of nuclear fuel cycle options. While CYCLUS has previously simulated system transitions from the current fuel cycle strategy to a future option, those tran- sitions have never previously been driven by market forces in the simulation. This work includes the first draft of a set of libraries that have been contibuted to the CYCLUS framework to enable a market-driven transition analysis.
The CYCLUS simulation framework is incomplete without a suite of dynamically loadable libraries representing the process physics of the nuclear fuel cycle (i.e. mining, fuel fabrication, chemical processing, transmutation, reprocessing, etc.). Within Cycamore, the additional modules repository within the CYCLUS ecosystem, provides some basic li- braries to represent these processes. However, extension of CYCLUS with new capabilities is community-driven, relying on contributions by user-developers. The libraries contributed in this work are examples of such contributions.
This work relies heavily on the CycStub repository which included contributions from myself, Kathryn Huff, as well as Matthew Gidden, Anthony Scopatz, Robert Carlsen, Paul Wilson, and Olzhas Rahkimov at the University of Wisconsin - Madison within the Computational Nuclear Engineering Research Group (CNERG).},

	abstract = {As an international nuclear company and one which is involved throughout the nuclear fuel cycle, a complete (holistic) understanding of the technicalities and economics of a range of nuclear fuel cycles is an important part of Nexia Solutions' business. To this end, Nexia Solutions has developed the capability to model and assess a range of reactor systems and fuel cycles using both “off the shelf” as well as bespoke software, including tools developed in-house. This paper presents a range of potential United Kingdom (UK) specific nuclear fuel cycle options for current, near, medium and long-term deployment that have been evaluated using these analysis tools and capabilities. These fuel cycles illustrate how the UK could utilize the plutonium stockpile and highlights some of the key issues for UK new nuclear build scenarios in the near, medium and long term.},
